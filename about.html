                    <h3>Tina is  the owner/head instructor of Body Balance Pilates.</h3>
                    <p>Tina has extensive experience as a top athlete, spending 18 years competing in track and field. Pilates was introduced to her by some of the top recovery specialists, mainly as a form of injury prevention and therapy for on-going sciatic nerve problems.</p>
                    <p>Since experiencing the transformative effects of Pilates for herself, it has been her vision to help enhance the lives of others and enable them to step into their power through the practise. </p>

                <p>WE LOOK FORWARD TO WELCOMING YOU</p>
                <h3>Whether you prefer Reformer Pilates or Mat Pilates, Body Balance is here to give you the best Pilates experience possible.</h3>
                <p>Our small sized Reformer Pilates classes allow us to give a more focussed and individualised class experience with the aim of it being energetic, balanced and fun.</p>
                <p>Body Balance looks to break the mould on the traditional Pilates experience by incorporating a more holistic approach. Each class is concluded with a short period of guided meditation, designed to help you feel more present, relaxed and uplifted.</p>
                <p>We strive to create connectedness within our space, by offering soul nourishing events such as Full Moon circles and Cacao Ceremonies to round out what we know will be a one of a kind experience.</p>
